# StereoBiter

is a tool that lets you match the percieved stereo width of a sample to an audio track.

Supply a sample to the program and it will determine the average percieved stereo width of the sample and apply it to the audio track in question. Mids can be seasoned to taste using the mid slider. Alternatively, users can select "match mids" to make the mids match.
